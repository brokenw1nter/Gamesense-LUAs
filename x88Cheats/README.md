# x88Cheats v2.0

## What is x88Cheats?
x88Cheats is a LUA that replicates the GUI of MasterLooser's cheat

## Changelog
###### [Version 2.0.1]
* Fixed "In Lobby" function

## Note
* Started this at the beginning of this year to learn the basics of LUA for another API but now that I'm here, I thought I would convert it then share it since I want to get some feedback on what I could do to improve my habits in LUA.
* I'm also stupidly dumb and can not for the life of me figure out how to check for the things listed in "Bugs".
* If you would like to help with this LUA, just let me know as I'm opened to anyone that wants to help perfect this LUA.
* Also I don't write LUAs so I don't know much about the API so if there are more efficient ways of doing what I have done, please let me know.

## Bugs
* "HS Only" hasn't been implemented yet due to me not knowing how to get the value of some of the items in the menu.
* "NoHands" doesn't check for Hands transparency, meaning it will display that it is on when you have Hands Chams enabled.
* "Chams" doesn't display material being used due to me not knowing how to get the value of an unnamed combobox.
* "MPoints" doesn't check or display anything also due to me not knowing how to get the value of the different comboboxes.

## Future Plans
* Function for Enabling ESP when Dead
* Function for loading visual settings to replicate @MasterLooser's
* Make the GUI interactive rather than just being a huge indicator.
* Making "Legit" and "SuperLegit" load preset settings, mainly to just turn off anything that would count as not Legit.
